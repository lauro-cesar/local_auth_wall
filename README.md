# local_auth_wall

Flutter widget to simplify local auth

## Getting Started

Local Auth wall redirect user to a widget when  authenticated and another if not.


## iOS Integration

```
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Why is my app authenticating using face id?</string>
```

## Android Integration 

The plugin will build and run on SDK 16+, but isDeviceSupported() will always return false before SDK 23 (Android 6.0).
Activity Changes

Note that local_auth requires the use of a FragmentActivity instead of an Activity. To update your application:

If you are using FlutterActivity directly, change it to FlutterFragmentActivity in your AndroidManifest.xml.

If you are using a custom activity, update your MainActivity.java:

```
    import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity;
    public class MainActivity extends FlutterFragmentActivity {
          // ...
    }
```
     
or MainActivity.kt:

``` 
      import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity

      class MainActivity: FlutterFragmentActivity() {
          // ...
      }
```

to inherit from FlutterFragmentActivity.

## Permissions

Update your project's AndroidManifest.xml file to include the USE_BIOMETRIC permissions:

``` 
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
package="com.example.app">
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC"/>
<manifest>

```



```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:local_auth_wall/local_auth_wall.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());

  // This widget is the root of your application.

        theme: ThemeData(
          // This is the theme of your application.
          //
          // Try running your application with "flutter run". You'll see the
          // application has a blue toolbar. Then, without quitting the app, try
          // changing the primarySwatch below to Colors.green and then invoke
          // "hot reload" (press "r" in the console where you ran "flutter run",
          // or simply save your changes to "hot reload" in a Flutter IDE).
          // Notice that the counter didn't reset back to zero; the application
          // is not restarted.

  // This widget is the home page of your application. It is stateful, meaning
  // that it has a State object (defined below) that contains fields that affect
  // how it looks.

  // This class is the configuration for the state. It holds the values (in this
  // case the title) provided by the parent (in this case the App widget) and
  // used by the build method of the State. Fields in a Widget subclass are
  // always marked "final".

      // _counter without calling setState(), then the build method would not be

    // by the _incrementCounter method above.

    // than having to individually change instances of widgets.
